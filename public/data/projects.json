The objective of solutions should be self-sustainability by increasing yield and reducing costs and wasted resources through increased efficiency.\n\nThe web application makes use of sockets to receive sensor data from farming racks, where it is processed on the backend and forwarded to the dashboard. On top of monitoring crop growth and conditions, numerous security features have been built into the system, including JSON Web Tokens for authentication, Role-based Access Control, Password Policies, Account Lockout, Logging, and more. It also allows the receiving of notifications via a Telegram bot and through emails.\n\nThrough this project, I have learnt how to do database modelling and implement stored procedures in MariaDB, caching data in Redis, and implement multiple web application security features. During the course of the FYP, we have also learnt to use the SCRUM methodology for project management, which allowed us to meticulously plan out our project timeline and tasks."

Credential Stuffing.\n\nIn the process of researching on the various vulnerabilties, we have created proof-of-concepts such as using webhooks for XSS attacks and brute-forcing tools. In the implementation of protection against the attacks, we have learnt to implement HTTPS for securing our data in transit, multi-factor authentication, account lockout, and more. All of these were knowledge not covered in school, but done through research and testing."
